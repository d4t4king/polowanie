# polowanie
A collections of scripts for parsing various logs on the Smoothwall Express firewall.

"Polowanie" is Polish for "hunting".  So, once considered in a "stable" state, these scripts will show you the outliers, in following with the concept of "long tail analysis".

However, feel free to check out the command line options (if they exist for a given tool).  I've tried to make '-h|-?|--help' work for most/all of the tools, except for the install script.
